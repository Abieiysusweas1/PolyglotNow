                <h4>What is Spanish?</h4>
                <p>Spanish is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula and is now spoken by more than 500 million people worldwide. It is the official language in Spain and most countries in Latin America, and is also widely spoken in the United States and other parts of the world.

                <h4>Alphabet</h4>
                <p>The Spanish alphabet consists of 27 letters. It is similar to the English alphabet but includes the letter ñ. The pronunciation of Spanish is generally regular, but it is important to learn the sounds of each letter to read and speak correctly from the start.</p>
